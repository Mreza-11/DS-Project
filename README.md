🖥 Framework Spotlight – OpenFL

Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) is an open-source framework designed to facilitate privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning across multiple institutions or edge devices. Developed with a modular and secure architecture, OpenFL supports a variety of aggregation algorithms, heterogeneous environments, and integration with deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
