**Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL)**

 | 

**By samples** (Different clients have different samples, but the same feature & label space).

 | 

Xi=Xj,Yi=Yj,Ii≠IjX_i = X_j, Y_i = Y_j, I_i \neq I_jXi​=Xj​,Yi​=Yj​,Ii​=Ij​

 | 

\- Smartphones, IoT devices collecting similar types of data.

 |
| 

**Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)**

 | 

**By features** (Different clients have different features, but the same sample space).

 | 

Xi≠Xj,Yi≠Yj,Ii=IjX_i \neq X_j, Y_i \neq Y_j, I_i = I_jXi​=Xj​,Yi​=Yj​,Ii​=Ij​

 | 

\- Medical institutions with different types of patient records.

 |
| 

**Federated Transfer Learning (FTL)**

 | 

**By both samples & features** (Different clients have different samples & features).

 | 

Xi≠Xj,Yi≠Yj,Ii≠IjX_i \neq X_j, Y_i \neq Y_j, I_i \neq I_jXi​=Xj​,Yi​=Yj​,Ii​=Ij​

 | 

\- Cross-domain learning where knowledge transfer is needed.
