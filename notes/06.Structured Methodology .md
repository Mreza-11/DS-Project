06.Structured Methodology

1. **Federated Learning Scenario and Data Distribution**
    
    - Distinguishing between Horizontal FL (HFL) and Vertical FL (VFL).
    - Identifying inherently federated datasets (e.g., FEMNIST, Sentiment140).
    - Simulating federated data distribution using IID and non-IID partitions (e.g., Dirichlet distribution for non-IID cases).
2. **Model Selection**
    
    - Choosing ML models based on the task (CNN for image classification, RNN for text analysis, decision trees for tabular data).
    - Utilizing pre-trained models for better performance with limited or non-IID data.
3. **Aggregation Strategy**
    
    - Using standard aggregators like FedAvg for deep learning models.
    - Implementing custom aggregators for models that cannot be expressed as parameter arrays (e.g., decision trees, k-means).
    - Exploring heterogeneous model aggregation via ensemble approaches.
4. **Training and Evaluation Strategy**
    
    - Defining key parameters such as the number of training rounds, participating clients per round, and optimization strategies.
    - Evaluating models at both **client level** (local performance) and **global level** (overall FL system performance).
