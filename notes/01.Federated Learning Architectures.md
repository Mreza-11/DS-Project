**Client-Server**

 | 

A central **server** coordinates and aggregates model updates from **clients** (nodes with local data).

 | 

\- Simple implementation.  
\- Efficient coordination of updates.

 | 

\- Requires high trust in the server.  
\- Vulnerable to attacks.

 |
| 

**Peer-to-Peer**

 | 

All nodes train local models **and** aggregate updates from others, without a central server.

 | 

\- Increased security and privacy.  
\- No single point of failure.

 | 

\- Complex implementation.  
\- Higher communication costs.
