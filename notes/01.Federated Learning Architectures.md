# **01. Federated Learning Architectures**

| **Architecture** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Client-Server** | A central **server** coordinates and aggregates model updates from **clients** (nodes with local data). | - Simple implementation.  <br> - Efficient coordination of updates. | - Requires high trust in the server.  <br> - Vulnerable to attacks. |
| **Peer-to-Peer** | All nodes train local models **and** aggregate updates from others, without a central server. | - Increased security and privacy.  <br> - No single point of failure. | - Complex implementation.  <br> - Higher communication costs. |
